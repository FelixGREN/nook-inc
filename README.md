# Nook Inc

**My first web project and site**

A simple landing page created with HTML, CSS and a speck of JS. There is both desktop and mobile support.
Designed using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). :rocket:

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/felixgren/nook-inc.git
cd nook-inc
```
Open locally, if you are using VSCode the [Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) is a good choice.
